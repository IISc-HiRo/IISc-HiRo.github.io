    <h1>Human-interactive Robotics Lab</h1>
    
    <p>
      The Human-interactive Robotics (HiRo) Lab is a research group in the <a href='https://cps.iisc.ac.in'>Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems</a> at the Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru set up and led by <a href='https://ravipr009.github.io/'>Prof. Ravi Prakash</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our group's research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, machine learning and human-robot interaction - with a focus on robot manipulation for real world applications i.e., healthcare, retail, space robots etc. The central principle is to enable humans with different levels of robotic expertise to transfer their knowledge and experience about skills and tasks to the robot to explore and execute the tasks in unstructured novel scenarios.
